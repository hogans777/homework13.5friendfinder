# homework13.5friendfinder

In this homework, I'll attempt to  build a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site 
will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.
Express to handle routing. Heroku will also be attempted.
